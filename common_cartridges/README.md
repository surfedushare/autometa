Create Simple Common Cartridge from PDF
=======================================

This project uses Claude Code to perform agentic tasks in the workspace of this directory.
It's under development and great care should be taken when opening up to real users as attack surfaces are large.

Installation
------------

You can install the Claude Code command using:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Usage
-----

Then you can start the agent and its prompt with:

```bash
cat prompts/learning_material.txt | claude
```
