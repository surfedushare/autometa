There is a simple Common Cartridge structure with simple example learning content inside examples/simple.
Next to it I want a more fancy version with TailwindUI.

Inside the tailwindui folder you'll find:
* a page-header to create the header which contains
  - the title (left)
  - download PDF button (right)
  - TOC button (far right)
* a right-drawer where the TOC can be hidden. It's shown when the TOC button is pressed in header or footer
* a footer navigation where with
  - Links to previous and next pages show on left and right side. Use page names instead of "next" and "previous"
  - In the center add a button that also opens the TOC drawer

For the TOC use or create an icon that depicts a bullet point list.

The design should be mobile friendly. Use white as background color. Green as primary color and yellow as call to action color.
No need to generate the final CSS file, but do include some Tailwind configuration files to play with colors and fonts.
