<p>Definitions of simulation
</p>
<p>The art and science of creating a representation of a process or system for the 
purpose of experimentation and evaluation
(Gogg and Mott, 1996)
</p>
<p>Computer simulation is the process of designing a mathematical-logical model of a 
real system and experimenting with this model on a computer
(Pritsker, 1986)
</p>
<p>Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over 
time
(Banks, Carson, &amp; Nelson, 1996)
</p>
<p>Simulation refers to a broad collection of methods and applications to mimic the 
behavior of real systems, usually on a computer with appropriate software

<p>Why do people use simulation models?
</p>
<p>Most systems are stochastic and dynamic
Analytical model not feasible and/or not practical.
</p>
<p>Trial by implementation can be too costly, or too time consuming, or 
even too dangerous.
</p>
<p>Timescale may be too long to get accurate real measurements.</p>

<p>Static versus dynamic
</p>
<p>A static model 
• Not dependent on time
</p>
<p>• A dice
</p>
<p>A dynamic model 
• Time dependent
</p>
<p>• Service and manufacturing related systems
• A few examples of dynamic variables: 
</p>
<p>• production schedules, 
• equipments utilizations, 
• customer arrival rates and processing times</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Discrete-event versus Continuous
</p>
<p>Discrete-event simulation 
• the state variables change instantaneously at separate points in time. 
• time is advanced in discrete “jumps” as the simulation advances from 
</p>
<p>event to event
• e.g. orders handled by servers.
</p>
<p>Continuous simulation
• the state variables change continuously with respect to time. 
• time is advanced in (almost) infinitely small increments
• e.g. mass-spring system</p>

<p>Stochastic versus deterministic
</p>
<p>A stochastic model contains processes controlled by random variables.
The word variables implies that something is capable of changing. It does 
not have a specific value, but rather a range of values. 
Random signifies that the changes can occur with no particular pattern. 
A stochastic process is composed of a sequence of randomly determined 
values. 
</p>
<p>A deterministic model does not contain random variables and is not 
influenced by probability</p>

<p>Step 1.2: Research Questions
</p>
<p>What is the percentage of customers that drive on without being served?
What is the effect of increasing the capacity of the queue area on the 
percentage of cars leaving without being served?</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Step 1.3 Scope
</p>
<p>Included in the model:
• The pump with service start and service end events. 
• The queue area with arrival, departure events
• The cars with the events matching the queue area and petrol events.
• The decision of the car to drive on when it finds the queue area full.
</p>
<p>Excluded from the model:
• The time for paying
• The volume of gas tanked
• The type of car
• The shop
• etc.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Manager’s perspective on decision
</p>
<p>Company looses money when customer leaves
• Each customer that leaves costs ?
</p>
<p>Does an investment in more queueing places pay off?
• How much does the additional queueing place cost?
• When should this be earned back? After one year?
• Doesn’t the waiting time increase too much?
</p>
<p>We can only measure number of customers that leave …</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Alternative decision frame 2
</p>
<p>Suppose:
• One extra queueing place costs 750 euros
• Each customer leaving ‘costs’ 100 euros
• Manager wants return on investment after 1000 customers
</p>
<p>Decision Frame:
• Objective: earn more money by serving more customers (decrease the number of 
</p>
<p>customers leaving because of full queue by extending the queue area)
• Decision variables: capacity of the queue area
• Performance measures: money lost by customers driving on because of a full 
</p>
<p>queue:
• number of customers lost * 100 euro’s + 
• number of additional queueing places * 750 euro’s</p>

<p>Exercise: the harbour case
A harbour can host two types of ships; Small and Big ships, which arrive with an 
interarrival time exponentially distributed with a mean of 5,5 hours and 6.7 hours 
respectively. There are two docks (dock1 and dock2) where ships can be unloaded.
</p>
<p>Small ships (big ships) are unloaded at dock1 (dock2) with a service time uniformly 
distributed between 3 and 7 (2 and 8). 
</p>
<p>If dock1 is empty and there are Big ships waiting at dock2 then a Big ship can go to dock1 
and is served with 1,5*Uniform(2,8). If dock2 is empty and there are Small ships waiting at 
dock1 then a Small ship can go to dock2 and is served with 2*Uniform(3,7).
For both docks the queue discipline is SPT (Shortest processing time first).
</p>
<p>The management team of the harbour would like to improve the mean expected 
throughput time. Possible options are closing dock1 to Big ships and dock2 to small Ships, 
or to change the queueing discipline.
</p>
<p>Formulate a decision frame for this problem, together with its research questions and 
scope
</p>
<p>34</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Proposed solution
</p>
<p>Problem formulation. Waiting by ships is expensive for their owner-
operators. For this reasons harbours could explore options to reduce waiting 
time. 
</p>
<p>Decision frame
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>Reduce mean expected 
throughput time
</p>
<p>Mean expected 
throughput time
</p>
<p>Queuing discipline; 
Resource allocation 
strategy</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Proposed solution (continue)
</p>
<p>Research questions
1. Does closing Dock1 to Big Ships and Dock2 to Small Ships improve the 
</p>
<p>mean expected throughput time of ships at the harbour? 
2. Is it better to use FIFO rule instead of SPT rule? 
</p>
<p>Scope
</p>
<p>• The docks with service start and service end events. 
• The queue with arrival, change queue and service start events. 
• The ships with the events matching the queue and dock events.

<p>Step 2.3: Simulation suitable?
</p>
<p>Characteristics of the system:
• Single class system
• No admission control
• One queue (FIFO) with limited capacity (3+1 = 4)
• One server
• A/B/M/K/N notation? ⇒ M/G/1/4 system
</p>
<p>Are there analytical methods available for M/G/1/4?
• No!
Can we make any approximation?
• Yes: M/M/1/4 system, but not precise enough!
Is direct experimentation possible?
• No!</p>

<p>Exercise: the harbour case
A harbour can host two types of ships; Small and Big ships, which arrive with an 
interarrival time exponentially distributed with a mean of 5,5 hours and 6.7 hours 
respectively. There are two docks (dock1 and dock2) where ships can be unloaded.
</p>
<p>Small ships (big ships) are unloaded at dock1 (dock2) with a service time uniformly 
distributed between 3 and 7 (2 and 8). 
</p>
<p>If dock1 is empty and there are Big ships waiting at dock2 then a Big ship can go to dock1 
and is served with 1,5*Uniform(2,8). If dock2 is empty and there are Small ships waiting at 
dock1 then a Small ship can go to dock2 and is served with 2*Uniform(3,7).
For both docks the queue discipline is SPT (Shortest processing time first).
</p>
<p>The management team of the harbour would like to improve the mean expected 
throughput time. Possible options are closing dock1 to Big ships and dock2 to small Ships, 
or to change the queueing discipline.
</p>
<p>Draw a black box representation for this problem. Is simulation needed? Why?
