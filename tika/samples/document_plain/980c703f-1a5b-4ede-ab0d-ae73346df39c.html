<p>Abstract
</p>
<p>This paper discusses the challenges and obstacles encountered in developing
and publishing Open Educational Resources (OER) in engineering ethics educa-
tion at a higher academic level, in the project Ethics Education for Engineers of
the 4TU.Centre for Ethics and Technology. The main aim is to contribute to the
larger project of providing OER at university level by providing insights gained from
the process of gathering and publishing materials. These insights are intended to be
suitable for use by other authors and teachers of OER. First, we provide an introduc-
tion describing the parties involved and the specific aim of our project. Second, we
describe the difficulties that were expected in the proposal phase of the project and
explain how we anticipated solving them. Third, we discuss the different problems
we encountered once the project was put into practice. We describe in what way we
answered to these unexpected challenges. Fourth, an overview is given of valuable
lessons learned and some practical take-aways acquired through experience. Here we
also discuss the challenges of making ethics modules suitable for empirically trained
students and mention some possible blind-spots that 4TU.Ethics might not be able
to consider from its sole perspective. Finally, we summarise what we have come to
understand are the most important steps in undertaking a project such as this by
manner of a blueprint for educators attempting something similar in the future.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The aim of the project Ethics Education for Engineers discussed in this paper is to
collect and open up materials for teaching ethics to engineering students. To introduce
it properly, we need to provide some context about the entity that initiated the project,
the 4TU.Ethics, and ethics education for engineers in the Netherlands.
</p>
<p>1.1 The 4TU.Centre for Ethics and Technology
</p>
<p>The Netherlands has four universities of technology, that cooperate through the 4TU
Federation [1]. The 4TU Centre for Ethics and Technology [2], 4TU.Ethics for short,
was founded by the Federation in 2007, as a centre of excellence linking the philoso-
phy departments of TUDelft (TUD), Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and
Twente University (UT). The philosophy group of Wageningen University &amp; Research
(WUR) joined the Centre in 2018. With a current size of about 43 senior researchers
and 84 junior researchers (PhDs and post-docs), as well as a global network of affiliated
researchers, 4TU.Ethics is a world leading centre in the field of ethics of technology. As
a community, the Centre aims to:
</p>
<p>• Understand ethical issues in the practice of engineering and technology develop-
ment, and contribute to better practices
</p>
<p>• Innovate education in the ethics of technology
</p>
<p>• Stimulate and perform research in the field of ethics and technology
</p>
<p>• Address societal challenges
</p>
<p>• Engage with societal stakeholders and public discussions about technology
</p>
<p>At each of the four universities, the local philosophy group provides ethics courses to
students of all educational programs. Based on this experience, members of 4TU.Ethics
have developed, and continue to develop, new methods and materials, as for instance
witnessed by one of the most successful textbooks in ethics in engineering worldwide
[3], an accompanying online educational tool, Agora [4], and a Massive Open Online
Course on Ethics, Technology and Engineering for professional education developed in
cooperation with Royal Netherlands Society of Engineers (KIVI) [5]. Sharing these
developments in the form of Open Educational Materials is a natural further step in
realising the Centre’s educational mission.
</p>
<p>1.2 Ethics education at the Dutch universities of technology
</p>
<p>The importance of ethics for engineering has been generally recognised, as part of the
competences for engineers of the 21th century [6]. All four universities have explicitly
included this in the learning outcomes for all their Bachelor’s and Master’s curricula
(see for instance [7]). Currently most students enrolling the four TUs will have taken at
</p>
<p>2</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>least one course involving ethics during their Bachelor’s (either as a dedicated course, or
embedded as part of another course), and probably another one as part of their Master’s.
Combined with a rise in student numbers over the past decade (enrolment in 2021 was
64,591: 34,259 Bachelor’s and 30,332 Master’s students [8]), this integration of ethics in
engineering curricula comes with a huge teaching load for the 4TU.Ethics community.
</p>
<p>A cornerstone of the practice of teaching ethics to engineering students is the case-
based exercise (CBE), where students learn to tackle ethical questions in context, i.e.
as they occur in relation to applications of technologies. In these case-based exercises
engineering students learn to apply ethical frameworks and develop competencies such
as moral sensibility, moral creativity, and moral argumentation and judgement skills [9].
The CBE-approach of teaching ethics in context arose directly from the teachers’ expe-
rience, but fits the more general model of so-called ‘problem-based learning’ [10] which
has been increasingly popular in the past decades in higher education [11]. Engineering
education in particular relies heavily on problem-based learning, which means that stu-
dents are familiar with the approach, as it is used throughout their curriculum. Hence,
case-based exercises have become a central instrument in ethics teaching in 4TU.Ethics.
</p>
<p>1.3 The Ethics Education for Engineers project
</p>
<p>Teachers in the 4TU.Ethics community develop CBEs for use in their courses to students
in different engineering disciplines, addressing a wide variety of technologies. However,
the development of these educational material has so far been largely an individual ac-
tivity. CBEs are sometimes shared locally among close colleagues, but there are no
channels or processes in place for systematically sharing these materials among teachers
at the different universities. Both teachers and students could benefit significantly from
an efficient way to develop and share up-to date materials for teaching ethics in engi-
neering. The integration of ethics in the campus curriculum requires a lot of tailor-made
arrangements with the educational programs. Having a communal collections of CBEs
different technology domains (suited for co-teaching with non-ethicists) will support this
process. Rather than solving this problem inside the community, 4TU.Ethics decided to
broaden the scope and set out to share and produce ethics teaching materials as Open
Educational Resources (OER).
</p>
<p>Open Educational Resources are materials for teaching, learning and research that
are publicly accessible and released under an open license allowing free access, use,
adaptation and redistribution by others without any restrictions. This flexible, collective
movement of shared information is strongly connected to the belief in the human right to
the access of high-quality education. The project of creating OER stands for reducing the
general cost of education as well as for broad participation, cooperation and co-creation.
As such, OER can be seen to be part of a systemic change in learning and teaching
content by engaging educators in new participatory processes and effective technologies
in education ([12], [13], [14], [15], [16]).
</p>
<p>Given that the local goals of 4TU.Ethics matched the global goals of OER, the Centre
initiated the Ethics Education for Engineers project, with the aim to collect and publish
60 ethics CBEs created by the 4TU.Ethics community in an unambiguous, structured
</p>
<p>3</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>and open manner for reuse in all the study programmes of the institutions involved,
and beyond. This required improving and updating of existing materials, adding new
materials and ensuring that all material is suitable for reuse by fellow lecturers and
in co-teaching. Also a process had to be put in place to sustain the publication of
CBEs after the project ends. The project ran from September 2019 to March 2022 and
was supported by a grant from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science,
which has an Open and online education incentive scheme [17]. During this time, we
have gathered experience and knowledge by developing and distributing materials and
answering to different challenges. In this paper we describe how we dealt with both the
expected and the unexpected difficulties that were encountered in the process. We hope
the answers and solutions that we found will be of use for other practitioners in building
their own collections of materials. Of course, we have to keep in mind that the scope
of the project is limited to education in English for engineering students in universities
comparable to the 4TU institutions. Moreover, the project’s main beneficiaries are ethics
instructors familiar with case-based exercises (CBEs) and working with Western ethical
theories. As such, a further aim of this paper is to address the academic, educational
and normative assumptions that underlie our project.
</p>
<p>2 Project preparation
</p>
<p>The aim of the current section is to describe from our perspective what the main chal-
lenges consisted in when developing the outlines of our project. We discuss three prob-
lems that were anticipated yet challenging, and explain in what manner we addressed
them in the project.
</p>
<p>2.1 Making ethics materials available to a wide audience
</p>
<p>In developing open educational materials, a first challenge is to design them in a manner
suitable for a wide audience. Materials should be as accessible, understandable and
useable as possible. Certain theories and ethical concepts that are used self-evidently
in one place might not be suitable for direct use in another place. For the materials
to be as widely applicable as possible, they must be able to accommodate a variety
of perspectives. We had to consider what one assumes about others when developing,
what we might accidentally impose and how could we keep development open towards
the future.
</p>
<p>A first answer we came up with was a bottom-up approach. This means that the
primary inspiration for a CBE would consist in an idea provided by an academic expert
active in the ethical field. Concretely, we wanted to approach teachers and professors
and ask them to share their teaching materials. These texts, papers, presentations and
other documents could then be transcribed into a shareable format by editors. This
way, rather than imposing a rigid structure from the umbrella body and asking teachers
to meet its requirements, the theories and working methods would spring from practice
and experience.
</p>
<p>4</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Secondly, we decided to focus on case-based exercises (CBEs). For reasons explained
above (Section 1.2) CBEs have become a central instrument in the teaching practice
of the 4TU.Ethics community. On the highest level of description, they consist of two
elements. The story (sometimes called “the case”) introducing the topic of the exercise,
explaining the main features on the technology involved and the most salient aspects
of its application in a particular situation, often providing the students with further
sources to consult to study the situation at hand in more detail. Traditionally, the story
is presented by means of a written text, but one can also use other forms such as doc-
umentaries, movies, podcasts, etc. The second element are the educational instructions,
specifying the ethical issues the students have to address in the situation and the activi-
ties they should engage in to do so. CBEs can employ a wide range of activities. Besides
writing papers, students can for instance be asked to engage in structured debate, in
role play, or in product design.
</p>
<p>CBEs come in different sizes, ranging from a short exercise that takes one or two
lesson hours in class, to the main assignment of a course, requiring 2-3 ec’s of student
work. Hence, offering teaching materials in the form of a CBE, allows for modular
(re)use. Instructors can pick exercises based on topic (story), or ethical framework or
activities used or size (educational instructions). As CBEs share a common structure,
they can easily be dismantled, reassembled and appropriated by teachers to fit their
specific educational objectives. In this way, we can ensure both the availability of a wide
range of topics and a consistent applicability of the materials.
</p>
<p>2.2 Covering a wide range of topic in the engineering ethics field
</p>
<p>In coming up with a way to develop materials for as broad a range as possible, we started
by acknowledging that it is impossible to do so in an all-encompassing manner. The
range of existing technologies is too large to be included in full in any single collection of
educational materials. Also, new innovations constantly emerge as well as new theories
regarding the ethics of these technologies. One way to deal with this is to aim for an
abundance of exercises, to increase the probability that an instructor can find something
to their liking. Within the scope of the project (aiming for 60 CBEs) this is not feasible
and even with a sustained collection effort over time, it will be difficult to keep up with
developments.
</p>
<p>Eventually, we decided to focus on three large technology domains that are prominent
in the research of 4TU.Ethics:
</p>
<p>• Digital technologies (Artificial Intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things, social me-
dia, blockchain, etc.)
</p>
<p>• Bio- and medical technologies (gene editing, synthetic biology, neurotechnology,
agricultural and food technologies, etc.)
</p>
<p>• Energy and environmental technologies (energy technologies, water technologies,
recycling technologies, climate engineering, etc.)
</p>
<p>5</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>The idea was to structure the development of the collection by using a matrix for ordering
the CBEs in the collection according to the technology domain in which they are situated
and the ethical concepts/theories they employ.
</p>
<p>On the one hand, case-based exercises should inform students about the state of
knowledge regarding a certain topic and worldly events. These topics can be highly
specialised in scientific disciplines or deeply connected to novel technological advance-
ments of our time. On the other hand, these exercises must provide students with the
means to make their own, justified decisions and arguments based on their personal,
active ethical reflection. This twofold aim of developing empirically informed exercises
that invite performative ethics will remain a major challenge. Staff that is specialised
both in ethical philosophy and a specific domain of empirical technoscience is scarce.
As the CBE has to be designed in such a way that a certain ethical problem comes for-
ward, the provided information about the concrete state of affairs can never be displayed
truly ‘neutrally’ or objectively. The challenge is to balance normative perspectives with
technical knowledge.
</p>
<p>We aimed to work with this distinction by separating the informative theory, double-
checked by experts in relevant fields, from the practical exercises in each CBE. The
informative or empirical framework should present a state of affairs in a neutral and
objective way and ruling out possible untruths, while the ethical exercise should enable
students to actively shape their own thoughts on the matter. At all four universities
focus groups exist that research a specific topic. The aim was to seek out scholars
with different specialisations to edit and develop cases, making the most of available
specialised knowledge. Cooperation and inviting a multitude of perspectives seem to be
key in answering to this challenge.
</p>
<p>2.3 Collecting the materials from the four universities
</p>
<p>For the collection of materials, we conceived the following approach. Within each of
the universities, we wanted to approach groups of experts in the ethics of technology
fields who were actively teaching these matters. These expert groups could then share
the teaching materials they had developed for their own courses with the 4TU.Ethics
umbrella task group. As the focus, topics and theories substantially overlap amongst
the four universities, this collection of materials would also lead to the finalisation of
the learning objectives and outcomes as well as the structuring of exercises in specific
steps. Accordingly, the project aimed to appoint two people from each university, prefer-
ably high-profile scholars, to be responsible for building the collection. We assumed these
scholars could intermediate the communication with the teachers and obtain their teach-
ing materials.
</p>
<p>3 Project implementation
</p>
<p>In this section we will describe the pitfalls and challenges encountered in the process of
actually building the collection, once the project got underway.
</p>
<p>6</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>3.1 Defining a format
</p>
<p>There is a tension between universality and particularity at stake in defining a format for
the publication of OER. Because, although the materials should be fit for worldwide use,
they must always be drawn up by specific persons in specific situations. Inevitably, any
scholar anywhere is always bound to specific (groups of) academics, courses, interests,
topics, media, cultures, and other such variables. Having access to a global community
of researchers is something quite novel, as are developments in the direction of efficient
interdisciplinarity. A logical way to deal with this differentiated situation is by devising
a template, a format. But this means that developers of OER in ethics necessarily have
to create openly on the one hand while working in a widely understandable format -
i.e. strictly defined and as such not open - on the other hand. A format is in itself
both a way to structure and create knowledge and something that reduces or closes
off other possibilities of knowledge. Yet, if one wants to create educational materials
that are (re)usable, the importance of a clean, instantly transparent format cannot be
overestimated.
</p>
<p>In ethics of technology, one often encounters ill-structured moral problems. Differ-
ences in opinion will always exist in ethics and many debates are still on-going and
ethicists continuously work with a plurality of theories. Next to the classical Western
theories, virtue ethics, utilitarianism and deontology, a multitude of other frameworks
and theories are employed in such as for instance risk ethics, care ethics, value-sensitive
design, codes of conduct, responsible research and innovation, and postphenomenology.
Moreover, these theories are not mutually exclusive and in continuous, active discussion
with each other. The challenge from a pedagogical angle is, therefore, to ensure an
exercise enables students to work through the ethical considerations in the most fruitful
way possible, i.e. obtaining as many insights and as a wide a reflection as possible.
</p>
<p>To allow for this variety in defining a format for CBEs, we drew inspiration from
the “Ethical cycle” as developed by van de Poel and Royakkers [19], which is depicted
in Figure 3. The ethical cycle views the formulation of a moral problem, of the possible
solutions and of the ethical evaluation of these solutions as intertwined aspects of the
one, possibly iterative process.
</p>
<p>From analysing an initial batch of CBEs collected from teachers in the community,
we learned that the a more general process definition was needed to capture the variety
present in practice. This process is depicted in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>We take a case-based exercise to consists of a series of steps. A CBE starts with a
story, which introduces a particular application of technology and provides the relevant
contextual factors. The students then go through one or more distinct steps in which
they answer a set of coherent questions. Each step has inputs, (such as the story for
step 1), and an output, the answers to the set of coherent questions belonging to the
step. If the CBE has multiple steps, the outputs of earlier steps (possibly combined
with additional materials) are used as inputs to later steps. With every step comes an
activity in which students engage to answer the question of the step (e.g. literature
study, debate, or role play). Teachers are free to define the kind of steps as well as the
</p>
<p>7</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>Figure 1: General structure of a case-based exercise.
</p>
<p>number of steps in the CBE as long as they stick to this general structure1
</p>
<p>The activities in the steps contribute to the learning outcomes for CBEs defined in
the project, listed in Appendix A. This set of learning outcomes was obtained for an
analysis of the first batch of exercises collected from all four institutions. The learning
outcomes present in these exercises were identified, restructured and rewritten into a
foundational set of learning objectives, and validated with the community. In this way,
a general consensus was identified and accordingly condensed into a viable format. To
help teachers in monitor the students’ progress during the teaching of an exercise, every
CBE contains a small proto-rubric in which the authors describe when according to their
experience the activity in a step is going well or not so well, based on the process the
students are going through or the output they produce in the step (see Section 4.3).
</p>
<p>After validating the format, by discussing it with teachers in the community, it was
used to create a template for the description of CBEs [20] that was used throughout the
project.
</p>
<p>3.2 Structuring the collection
</p>
<p>Our initial idea was to create a matrix for ordering the CBEs according to the technology
domain in which they are situtated and the ethical concepts/theories they employ as the
</p>
<p>1Formally speaking, a CBE is represented as a directed acyclic graph of steps connected through
inputs and outputs. If an exercise contains iterations, these can be accommodated by “unfolding” the
loops and adding the repeated steps to the graph.
</p>
<p>8</p>
<p />

<div class="page"><p />
<p>framework for building the collection. We collected a first batch of CBEs from teachers
in 4TU.Ethics to see if this top-down idea would fit the practice of the community. With
regards to the technology domains, the proposed categories Digital &amp; ICT, Health and
Biotechnologies and Energy and Environmental technologies made sense for the collected
materials, but we found a group of CBEs that were less concerned with the specifics of a
particular application of technology than with the organisational and political aspects of
the engineering profession, such as problems of responsibility. For these we introduced
a new category Engineering Practice. The ethical concepts and theories found in the
collected materials matched our expectations, but it turned that it is quite common for
CBEs to address multiple theories, which makes a simple matrix less useful as framework
for organizing the collection.
</p>
<p>Figure 2: Contents and structure of the Ethics Education for Engineers repository.
</p>
<p>By that time, we had chosen edusources as the platform for publishing the CBEs.
Using the facilities offered by this platform we settled on a more flexible ordering of CBEs
in “collections”, where materials are grouped under a common heading, while allowing for
links between individual materials in different collections. The materials in the repository
are organised in seven collections, accessible from the 4TU.Ethics community page on
edusources [21]. Figure 2 depicts this structure. The Case-Based Exercises (CBEs) are
divided over 4 collections based on the technology domain in which they are situated:
Digital and ICT, Bio and health technologies, Environmental and energy technologies,
and Engineering practice. For every CBE a teacher version is provided. CBEs can
also have a separate student version that can be handed out, and some have additional
materials (like role description in a role playing exercises) are needed to conduct the
</p>
<p>9</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>CBE in class. The Educational formats collection contains the descriptions of exercises
forms that are applicable to a wider variety of technologies, and the collection Ethics
glossary contains short introductions of the central concepts and frameworks from ethics
occurring in the CBEs, that can be used by students for self-study.The records for case-
based exercises in the repository are linked to the entries for the ethical concepts and
frameworks occurring in them, and can also be linked to descriptions of the educational
formats employed.
</p>
<p>This structure fits the community practice. It allowed us to classify all further CBEs
developed over the course of the project, and provides teachers with an intuitive way
to browse the educational materials. It is also future proof: if needed, further domain
categories can be added to cope with the advent of new technologies, and developments
in ethics research (such as the current interest in non-Western approaches) that find
their way into teaching can be accommodated by extending the ethics glossary.
</p>
<p>To make the repository self-documenting, we have added the Toolkit collection, which
contains reference documents to support the creation of new materials in the vein of
the project, such as the developed templates for case-based exercises and educational
formats, the set of learning outcomes for CBEs and explanations of procedures for con-
tributing new materials to the repository.
</p>
<p>3.3 The missing link: editors
</p>
<p>After having determined the CBE-format, the learning outcomes and the structure of
the collection, some of the collected materials were developed into CBE descriptions
according to the template by the project team and tested in trial-runs. These CBEs
proved fairly easy to use, as the preliminary feedback from several teachers showed us.
However, we also found that we could not ask teacher to convert their own teaching
materials. The main bottleneck was not the absence of teaching materials or ideas,
but the effort required to get the materials to the standard where they can be easily be
understood and used in class by other teachers. Especially in times of Covid-19, teachers
did not have the required time and focus to do this independently.
</p>
<p>To fill the gap between the teacher contributing materials and the project group
overseeing the publication of CBEs, a new role was introduced, that of editor. Editors
were trained in each of the four groups to assist teachers in getting their materials to
the point where they could be published. The process was as follows: teachers were
approached locally to contribute existing CBEs or ideas for new ones to the project.
The materials they submitted, in whatever form, were converted into a CBE description
according to the template by an editor. The editor and teacher would then discuss
this new description to make sure that the editor had correctly captured the teacher’s
intent and to fill in any missing information required by the template. Once a CBE was
complete, it would go to the project group, who would perform a final quality check and
publish it on the edusources platform.
</p>
<p>In this way the project goal of publishing an initial collection of 60 CBEs as OER was
reached. To maintain and grow the collection in future, 4TU.Ethics strives to maintain a
certain editing capacity in its community to support publication of further CBEs. We do
</p>
<p>10</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>think that, now that an initial collection of reusable materials from their community is
available and teachers are getting more familiar with the standard formats, the threshold
for them to contribute to the collection will become lower.
</p>
<p>4 Lessons learned and practical take-aways
</p>
<p>The aim of this section is to share some insights acquired during the implementation
of the project within 4TU.Ethics. By identifying possible pitfalls and encountered chal-
lenges, we hope to inform and prepare those starting similar projects. The more fun-
damental difficulties that we came across and that helped in obtaining these practical
take-aways will be elaborated upon in the following sections.
</p>
<p>4.1 Production of individual CBEs
</p>
<p>With regards to the existence of teaching materials, there is less scarcity than one might
expect. Everywhere in academic institutes, professors and teachers have been passion-
ately giving courses, lessons and engaging tutorials to BA and MA students for years
or even decades. Not sharing this experience would be a waste of energy and time. As
such, we found that simply asking these teachers to share as much materials as possible
was a highly efficient way to obtain verified teaching resources. If just a few people have
the means to dedicate themselves to the structuring and organising of these materials,
the experience is conserved with relative ease and new generations of teachers will not
have to re-invent the wheel each time they build a course.
</p>
<p>A strongly related insight concerns the current demand for OER in ethics. As the
number of students in technical fields is rising, the need for ethics education rises as
well, indicating that OER in ethics will always be welcome. The aim of supplying
materials that can be reused and appropriated by teaching staff poses demands different
from teaching materials developed for personal or local use. However, teachers are
always already under the pressure of a large workload and have hardly any extra time to
orient themselves in the fields of available educational modules, especially if the themes
therein deviate from their own expertise. Longer term, this situation could be improved
by having teachers develop their materials in a specific template by providing them
with incentives such as traceable publication of their materials (DOI), exposure on the
platform and being part of an active community of OER builders that meet regularly
and exchange materials.
</p>
<p>Currently, beginning an interdisciplinary, inter-academia (and ideally, international)
project like making OER in ethics in first instance will only cost precious time for
teachers and scholars that are asked to submit teaching materials. This means additional
resources are required to train editors and developers organising the rough materials.
In this respect 4TU.Ethics is a privileged position, as a community of qualified scholars
that can decide to invest time in common projects.
</p>
<p>A third challenge that must be mentioned here consists in dealing with copyright
issues. Intellectual property has value and not everyone might be eager to share the
</p>
<p>11</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>work they spent so much time on. Peer-reviewed research cannot just be attached
to OER. Neither is it possible to include every graph, image, table, or document of
reference that editors of OER would have initially preferred. The copyrights required
for open access publishing are quite narrow and must be checked carefully by someone
knowledgeable in the field. We are currently still challenged by the compatibility of
differing open licences. Combining materials published under different licences leads to
a situation in which the most restrictive one determines the licence of the whole. We are
dealing with this issue by using creative commons for all images, rewriting, summarising
and referencing relevant research not yet freely available, contacting original authors for
permission and by including downloadable open-access files to certain materials. For
example, we have changed the files from PDF to docx upon recommendation by library
institutions.
</p>
<p>Lastly, we found that developing CBEs in workshops with groups of teachers con-
stitutes an engaging exercise from which a lot of wisdom can be obtained. Besides the
fact that instructors enjoy working on materials in groups, such cooperation also yields
a manifold of valuable insights. Combining different perspectives and areas of exper-
tise provides a view on the richness of the examples at stake in the exercises and offers
knowledge on all the different directions in which a lesson can be developed.
</p>
<p>4.2 Building the collection
</p>
<p>The first insight with regards to the development of the collection is that teachers that
are in need of additional educational resources often do not know where to start looking.
They will still feel the responsibility to provide their classes with both scientifically accu-
rate information and solid ethical theories. Unlike commercial commodities, educational
resources cannot be advertised in a public, market-driven manner. While a number of
teachers feel that anything published by other teachers can pose a viable inspiration
for colleagues, in a structural project it is also necessary to consider how to establish a
certain guarantee of quality. In weighing the role of trust and how to obtain it in the
context of the materials at stake, clear design-choices have to be made.
</p>
<p>A related challenge consists in coming up with materials that are both specific to the
studies in which they are used - which might differ from biology to engineering to social
sciences - and useable in the most general sense possible. We consider the availability
of both diverse experts and capable editors to be key in answering to this challenge.
Also, in order to keep up with developments in technological innovation, educational
objectives and pedagogic approaches, it is necessary to consistently and structurally
keep expanding, updating and refreshing the collection of materials.
</p>
<p>4.3 (Re)use of materials
</p>
<p>We have learned how to formulate the instructions for assignments concisely and specif-
ically. Although any instructor should always have the freedom to appropriate and
modify all materials, they should be able to teach an exercise directly from its descrip-
tion. For this purpose it is helpful to write out every step involved in the assignment
</p>
<p>12</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>with examples and overviews. A clear determination of ideal group-sizes can only be
beneficial to include. Also when variations are likely, writing out a table with possible
group-sizes depending on the size of the total group saves instructors time on prepara-
tion. Building exact, unambiguous instructions is needed, even if instructors would opt
to take a different approach. Wherever time can be saved for instructors, one should try
to do so in the materials.
</p>
<p>The development of scoring rubrics also provides some guidance for instructors to
anticipate the behaviour and participation of involved students. The design choice of
using pre-written rubrics here to enable summative testing is contested, especially in
ethics education, where answers are never binary, yet we feel teachers do not have to use
these provided instruments if they do not desire so. In terms of editing, it proved entirely
feasible to map out the diverse attitudes of engagement to be expected per question in
a matrix with a scale of unsatisfactory-satisfactory-excellent. Here is an example of the
manner in which we did this:
</p>
<p>Step Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Excellent
</p>
<p>1 Did not read text Reads text Displays understanding
Does not raise hand Pays attention to Helpful input
Not paying enough attention introduction and video Adds to the conversation
</p>
<p>2 Not cooperating Cooperative Pulls group forwards
Not active in assigned group Works with group Makes visual model
Copies arguments from text Provides useful contribution to Introduces new ideas
instead of thinking for strategy or design and arguments
themselves that has to be made
</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . . .
</p>
<p>Table 1: Example of a scoring rubric as included in CBE format
</p>
<p>There also is a challenge of anticipation involved in the development of OER in ethics.
Anticipating all the possible answers, arguments, angles, perspectives and concepts that
might come to the fore when teaching about a specific ethical theory or in the context
of a specific technology can be hard. This is of course also the beauty of education,
that students might come up with original, novel approaches of which instructors can
themselves learn in turn. In general, though, it turned out relatively feasible to list and
map out the main possible arguments that students tend to come up with in a certain
context. For each domain of ethics, and for disruptive technology reflected upon, certain
recurring themes can indeed be identified. Making transparent lists of what topics,
arguments and answers to expect when teaching an OER-module could prove helpful for
instructors working with the materials.
</p>
<p>We also found that teachers of ethics might not always feel confident talking about
specific empirical domains, about which the engineering students likely have better
knowledge. Again, the format in which a short and to-the-point story about the empiri-
cal background - verified by the expertise of the original teachers that provided the rough
materials for the CBE - constituted our strategy; in general, this focused exposition of
</p>
<p>13</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>relevant facts suffices for ethics instructors to talk about the moral aspects involved.
In our experience a fruitful synergy can be achieved in which students learn to think
ethically about their empirical work, while teachers learn new things about the empirical
counterparts of their research in ethics.
</p>
<p>4.4 Didactical points of departure
</p>
<p>A strategy that we wanted to share concerns our model of a procedural approach. Re-
flecting about ethics is not a rigid process and can take all kinds of shapes and forms.
However, embedding the main elements in an encompassing overview can be valuable
for the (hermeneutic) insight of an instructor practicing one of the elements. In this
manner, teachers have a feeling as to where in the process they find themselves and
how they can work towards a comprehensive, plenary outcome. Below in Figure 3 we
show the model of the Ethical Cycle [19] which was used as a preliminary inspiration
for our procedural approach. However, as we were in need of a more general procedural
approach, because not everybody favours the model of the Ethical Cycle, we expanded
and appropriated this model in our finalised structure.
</p>
<p>Figure 3: Example of a procedural approach: the Ethical Cycle models structures an
exercise in a number of steps (each consisting of a number of questions), addressing
specific learning goals.
</p>
<p>What we noticed in developing CBEs for ethics education, furthermore, was that
students in advanced empirical fields often struggle with comprehending ethics, as the
abstract domain of ethics does not have an objective, measurable definition or system
of thought to build upon. Ethics are dependent on diverse perspectives and differing
situations of application. Our answer was found in the model of the CBE, in which an
empirical, concrete and manageable case is presented that students recognise from their
own theoretical backgrounds. This helps them to feel informed about their opinions and
to come up with ethical arguments relevant to their own fields.
</p>
<p>In revising the pedagogic as well as the ethical framework of the CBEs, an aspect
that stood out was that all the ethical theories currently used are Western. The specific
</p>
<p>14</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>methods, theories and perspectives used within 4TU.Ethics might not correspond to
the dominant themes and theories used in other places. This challenge can only be
truly met by broadening (international) cooperation. For now, 4TU.Ethics sidesteps
this issue by only including the main theories supported by its active researchers in the
respective fields. Given the current interest in non-Western approaches in the ethics of
technology and the widening international cooperation in the field, we have hope that
the collection will come to include CBEs drawing on Confucianism, Ubuntu philosophy,
Islamic philosophy, indigenous philosophies and Buddhism, among others.
</p>
<p>5 Overall blueprint
</p>
<p>At the end of this paper we wanted to summarise in chronological order the most valuable
insights we have obtained throughout our experience with this project. This roadmap
can serve as a checklist of elements that should at the very least be present if somebody
would want to undertake a project similar to ours.
</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have enough people on board. Gathering materials, converting them
into a viable format, supervising the general collection are all very time-consuming
aspects of such a project. Having an engaged staff that works on it weekly is
essential to its success.
</p>
<p>2. Train or hire specialists (editors) for converting the materials into a shareable
format. Teachers often have a great deal of educational resources at their disposal,
scarcity is not the problem. The esoteric nature of the texts, presentation and
hand-outs only used by one teacher, though, make it so that they are in need of
heavy editing.
</p>
<p>3. Put a lot of effort and thought into making the formats for the materials at the be-
ginning. The format determines the general structure of the collection but can also
reduce the need for specific types of information. A clear outline is therefore cru-
cial when beginning and without it a lot of time will be consumed by unnecessary
restructuring of materials.
</p>
<p>4. Test your materials with other teachers to make sure that these are actually teach-
able by others. We highly recommend running a pilot-phase of at least a year in
which materials, the format and the staff can try out their work. Revising the
general outset on the basis of these preliminary experiences helps to determine a
clear approach in the following years.
</p>
<p>5. Use feedback to improve upon the format. Education is a field that constantly
evolves and develops. Teachers accumulate a lot of specific knowledge through
experience. Listening to those active in the fields guarantees the applicability of
the materials.
</p>
<p>15</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>6. A modular approach helps to keep materials up-to-date. Building the collection
and the materials in it according to a modular structure was a valuable decision
in our experience. If a certain component gets outdated, it can easily be replaced
by the editors or even by the teachers themselves browsing the collection.
</p>
<p>7. Tie the project to an existing organisational structure For the longer-term future
of an OER project, is important to tie it to existing organisational structures, that
can ensure continuity of the production and sharing of the materials.
</p>
<p>As will be clear by now, producing OER is ambitious. It requires a lot of effort, and
one cannot expect teachers, editors and others to embark on such a project purely out
of passion. Asking them to invest their free time, or piling it on top of their other duties
does not create sustainable conditions for producing valuable OER. Teachers will need
time allocated to the project and support from their university. Hence our last and first
advice for undertaking an OER project: ensure funding.
</p>
<p>6 Conclusion
</p>
<p>In this paper, we have described the project of 4TU.Ethics of developing open-access
resources for ethics education in empirical domains such as engineering. As the umbrella-
institute of ethics for the four Dutch technical universities, we have elaborated upon our
specific approaches regarding the diverse challenges met in the undertaking. We have
listed the main practical take-aways, supplied insight into the format used to trans-
parently combine ethical and empirical educational information and discusses in more
detail some of the fundamental challenges in the background of this development. By
displaying these main challenges and describing the main ways in which we dealt with
them, we hope to inform and inspire editors, teachers, instructors, librarians and anyone
involved in similar projects. Cooperation, clarity, unification and inclusion seem to be
the key qualities required for projects like ours to be a success. As such, we hope to
extend our transparency to a context beyond 4TU.Ethics and to receive similar insights
from comparable undertakings, working towards a global collective of OER-publishers,
learning from each other and building towards more accessible, efficient, and complete
educational resources for ethics in higher education.
