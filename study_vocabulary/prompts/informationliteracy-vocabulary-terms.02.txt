Below between the <terms> tag you'll find a tree of terms in JSON format that can be relevant for information literacy study materials.
Underneath the terms you'll find a piece of study material between <study-material> tags also in JSON format.

First shortly summarize the study material between <summary> tags.

Then based on that summary propose term candidates that come from the tree. Write these between a <candidates> tag.

The next step is to reflect on your current selection and pick the final terms.
Be conservative with picking relevant terms. Only pick terms that are very likely applicable. It's expected that only a few nodes apply.
Important: parent terms apply automatically. Based on this rule some child terms may be inappropriate even if they appear correct at first.
Write your pick between a <picks> tag

Conclude with writing a JSON Array with all terms that are relevant for your summary inside of that Array.
It's also ok to respond with an empty Array. Include any parent terms from child terms that you've selected.

============================================================ Claude Sonnet 3.5 New
<summary>
This is a LibGuide about Research Data Management (RDM) from the VU University Library. It provides guidance on planning and managing research data, creating data management plans (DMPs), and related resources. The material covers topics like data collection, analysis, archiving, data set registration, legal aspects, regulations, costs, data protection, and classification. It's designed for university-level education and is presented as instructional material through a website.
</summary>
<candidates>
Given the summary, these terms seem potentially relevant:
- Organizing and processing
  - Using and processing information (ethical)
    - Privacy-sensitive information
- Orienting and specifying
  - Orienting to information landscape
    - Nature and manifestations of information/data
    - Value of information/data
- Critically evaluate
  - Assessing results (critical)
</candidates>
<picks>
After careful consideration and applying the parent-child rule, I'll select:
1. "Organizing and processing" - This is clearly relevant as the material deals with data management and processing
2. "Orienting to information landscape" (which includes its parent "Orienting and specifying") - This applies as the material helps users understand the nature of research data and its value in the academic landscape
I'm excluding "Using and processing information (ethical)" and its child "Privacy-sensitive information" despite their apparent relevance, as they seem too specific given that the material covers a broader range of RDM topics. Similarly, while "Critically evaluate" might seem relevant, it's not a primary focus of this instructional guide.

Thought for 26 seconds

Examining terms and study material

I’m analyzing a tree of terms about Information Literacy and reviewing a JSON-formatted study material on "Research Data Management". Summarizing the study material, I’ll then identify relevant term candidates, focusing on significant terms from the tree.

Choosing key terms

I’m figuring out the best terms for the summary. Also, I’m piecing together a JSON array with these relevant terms. This involves examining the study material and choosing terms that fit well.

Summarizing the resource

I’m thinking about understanding how a LibGuide helps with research data management and exploring related terms like RDM, data collection, and data protection. This will inform what terms to propose next.

Mapping out engagement

I’m thinking through the structure of Information Literacy, noting key areas like critical evaluation, organizing information, orienting to the landscape, planning searches, and communicating findings. Each sub-area highlights specific skills and focuses.

Evaluating the context

I'm mapping out relevant terms for Research Data Management, considering data planning, protection, archiving, classification, and legal aspects. Possible categories include Organizing and Processing, and Orienting and Specifying.

Examining data principles

I’m gathering info on data protection, law, and regulation, and their implications for ethical use and processing. This leads me to think through the associated child terms.

Figuring out pertinent aspects

OK, let me see: Organizing and processing data, ensuring ethical handling, and managing privacy-sensitive information seem crucial.

Choosing relevant terms

I’m selecting terms to include in the output JSON, ensuring they’re pertinent to the resource, like "Organizing and processing," "Using and processing information (ethical)," and "Confidentially-sensitive information."

Ensuring completeness

I’m thinking through including "Privacy-sensitive information" to ensure the relevance of data protection topics.

Clarifying requirements

Here's the deal: I’m honing in on the JSON array's terms, crafting a summary, suggesting candidate terms, and picking the top ones. It’s clear, concise, and policy-compliant.
