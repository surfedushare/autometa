Below between the <terms> tag you'll find a list of terms in JSON format that can be relevant for ${field} study materials.
Underneath the terms you'll find a piece of study material between <study-material> tags also in JSON format.
Shortly summarize the study material and conclude with writing a JSON Array with all terms that are relevant for your summary inside of that Array.
Be conservative with picking relevant terms. Only pick terms that are very likely applicable. It's expected that only a few terms apply. It's also ok to respond with an empty Array.

<terms>
