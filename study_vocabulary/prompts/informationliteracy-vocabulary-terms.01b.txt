Below between the <terms> tag you'll find a tree of terms in JSON format that can be relevant for information literacy study materials.
Underneath the terms you'll find a piece of study material between <study-material> tags also in JSON format.

First shortly summarize the study material between <summary> tags.

Then based on that summary propose term candidates that come from the tree. Write these between a <candidates> tag.

The next step is to reflect on your current selection and pick the final terms.
Be conservative with picking relevant terms. Only pick terms that are very likely applicable. It's expected that only a few nodes apply.
Important: parent terms apply automatically. Based on this rule some child terms may be inappropriate even if they appear correct at first.
Write your pick between a <picks> tag

Conclude with writing a JSON Array with all terms that are relevant for your summary inside of that Array.
It's also ok to respond with an empty Array. Include any parent terms from child terms that you've selected.
