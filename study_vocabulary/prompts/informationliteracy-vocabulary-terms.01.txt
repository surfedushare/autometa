Below between the <terms> tag you'll find a tree of terms in JSON format that can be relevant for information literacy study materials.
Underneath the terms you'll find a piece of study material between <study-material> tags also in JSON format.

First shortly summarize the study material between <summary> tags.

Then based on that summary propose term candidates that come from the tree. Write these between a <candidates> tag.

The next step is to reflect on your current selection and pick the final terms.
Be conservative with picking relevant terms. Only pick terms that are very likely applicable. It's expected that only a few nodes apply.
Important: parent terms apply automatically. Based on this rule some child terms may be inappropriate even if they appear correct at first.
Write your pick between a <picks> tag

Conclude with writing a JSON Array with all terms that are relevant for your summary inside of that Array.
It's also ok to respond with an empty Array. Include any parent terms from child terms that you've selected.

============================================================ Claude Sonnet 3.5 New
<summary>
This study material is a module on the responsible use of Generative AI created by Maastricht University Library. The module aims to teach users about what Generative AI is, including its opportunities and limitations, as well as providing guidelines for appropriate usage. The content covers aspects like academic integrity, transparency, copyright, privacy, plagiarism, bias, and proper referencing in the context of AI usage.
</summary>
<candidates>
Based on the summary, these terms appear potentially relevant:
- Information Literacy
- Critically evaluate
  - Assessing results (critical)
    - Assessment criteria (relevance/reliability)
- Organizing and processing
  - Using and processing information (ethical)
    - Copyright
- Orienting and specifying
  - Orienting to information landscape
    - Nature and manifestations of information/data
</candidates>
<picks>
After careful consideration, I'll select these terms:
1. "Information Literacy" (root term)
2. "Critically evaluate" (due to focus on understanding AI limitations and proper assessment)
3. "Using and processing information (ethical)" (due to emphasis on responsible use, copyright, and academic integrity)
Note: While terms like "Nature and manifestations of information/data" might seem relevant, they're too specific given that the material appears to focus more on responsible use rather than technical understanding of AI systems.

Thought for 35 seconds

Summarizing and selecting

First, I need to provide a brief summary of the study material. Then, I identify term candidates from the tree, reflecting on the options, and finally, I pick the most relevant terms.

Concluding the process with a JSON Array of relevant terms, ensuring terms match the summary. Verification and compliance with guidelines, including potential disallowed or private content.

Reflecting on options

I’m thinking through the candidates, selecting final terms, and crafting the JSON array. This involves a careful review of the terms to ensure precision and relevance.

Examining study material

I’m digging into the topic of Generative AI, its benefits, challenges, and responsible use, detailing key terms like LLM, AI, and academic integrity.

Understanding Generative AI

In this overview, I’m looking at Generative AI, exploring its potential and constraints, and emphasizing best practices for its responsible use.

Focusing on key stages

I'm mapping out the terms and concepts across various stages of information literacy, including evaluating, organizing, orienting, planning, and publishing.

Piecing together terms

Hm, I’m thinking about ethical terms like copyright and privacy-sensitive info. Also, critical evaluation of results with criteria like relevance and reliability. Synthesizing new info is another key aspect to consider.

Evaluating key terms

Identifying critical terms from a module on Generative AI. Clarifying relevance, reliability, ethical use, and broader impact. Each term is thoroughly assessed for its educational value.

Identifying applicable terms

I’m pulling together terms like "Using and processing information (ethical)" and its subsets including Copyright and Privacy-sensitive information. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of necessary parent terms.

Ensuring compliance

I’m verifying that the JSON array for the assistant includes terms like "Organizing and processing," "Using and processing information (ethical)," "Copyright," and "Privacy-sensitive information." This ensures it stays within the safe boundaries.

<summary> This module educates learners about Generative AI, helping them understand its concepts, recognize its opportunities and limitations, and learn the ethical considerations and best practices for responsible use.
